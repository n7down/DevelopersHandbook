## Writing Code
When writing solutions in software there are four things to keep in mind:
1. Ensure that the code is a full representation of the solution and must remain consistent within the language, platform, curent architecture, and all the warts of the current system.
2. The code must solve the problem set for you by the customer.
3. Code must fit well into the existing system and should not increate rigidity, fragility, or opactiy of the system and must follow solid engineering principles.
4. Code must be readable by other programmers. This does not simply meen nice comments. Rather it reavels your intent.
