# Flashlight
Code kata to solve the flashlight problem:
Given a group of people with one flight light. These people need to cross a bridge where only two people at a time can cross it. It can take each person between 1 and 8 days to cross the bridge. The time it takes for two people to cross the bridge is the larger time it takes of the two people. For example if Jerry and Tim takes three and four days to cross the bridge respectively. Then it will take both Jerry and Tim four days to cross the bridge. After traveling accross the bridge a person would have to bring the flightlight back to the group and two other people would again have to cross the bridge. Until every person in the group is across the bridge in the shortest time possible.
