Some helpful utility snippets:

- Test k<sup>th</sup> bit is set: `num & (1 << k) != 0`.
- Set k<sup>th</sup> bit: `num |= (1 << k)`.
- Turn off k<sup>th</sup> bit: `num &= ~(1 << k)`.
- Toggle the k<sup>th</sup> bit: `num ^= (1 << k)`.
- To check if a number is a power of 2, `num & num - 1 == 0`.

### Mutable and Immutable Objects
Mutable objects have fields that can be changed, immutable objects have no fields that can be changed after the object is created.

A very simple immutable object is a object without any field. (For example a simple Comparator Implementation).

```
class Mutable{
	private int v;

	public Mutable(int value) {
		this.v = value;
	}

	public int Value
	{
		get
		{
			return v;
		}
		set
		{
			v = value;
		}
	}
}

class Immutable {
	private final int value;

	public Immutable(int value) {
		this.value = value;
	}

	public int Value 
	{
		get { return value; }
		private set;
	}
}
```
