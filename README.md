# Design Patterns 

<a name="creational"></a>
## Creational 
- [ ] Abstract Factory
    - Creates an instance of several families of classes
- [ ] Builder
    - Separates object construction from its representation
- [ ] Factory Method
    - Creates an instance of several derived classes
- [ ] Object Pool
     - Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
- [ ] Prototype
     - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
- [ ] Singleton
     - A class of which only a single instance can exist

<a name="structural"></a>
## Structural 
- [ ] Adapter
     - Match interfaces of different classes
- [ ] Bridge
     - Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
- [ ] Composite
     - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
- [ ] Decorator
    - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- [ ] Facade
    - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
- [ ] Flyweight
     - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
- [ ] Private Class Data
     - Restricts accessor/mutator access
- [ ] Proxy
    - An object representing another object

<a name="behavior"></a>
## Behavoir
- [ ] Chain of responsibility
     - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
- [ ] Command
     - Encapsulate a command request as an object
- [ ] Interpreter
     - A way to include language elements in a program
- [ ] Iterator
     - Sequentially access the elements of a collection
- [ ] Mediator
     - Defines simplified communication between classes
- [ ] Memento
    - Capture and restore an object's internal state
- [ ] Null Object
     - Designed to act as a default value of an object
- [ ] Observer
    - A way of notifying change to a number of classes
- [ ] State
     - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
- [ ] Strategy
    - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
- [ ] Template method
    - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
- [ ] Visitor
    - Defines a new operation to a class without change

Some helpful utility snippets:

- Test k<sup>th</sup> bit is set: `num & (1 << k) != 0`.
- Set k<sup>th</sup> bit: `num |= (1 << k)`.
- Turn off k<sup>th</sup> bit: `num &= ~(1 << k)`.
- Toggle the k<sup>th</sup> bit: `num ^= (1 << k)`.
- To check if a number is a power of 2, `num & num - 1 == 0`.

### Mutable and Immutable Objects
Mutable objects have fields that can be changed, immutable objects have no fields that can be changed after the object is created.

A very simple immutable object is a object without any field. (For example a simple Comparator Implementation).

```
class Mutable{
	private int v;

	public Mutable(int value) {
		this.v = value;
	}

	public int Value
	{
		get
		{
			return v;
		}
		set
		{
			v = value;
		}
	}
}

class Immutable {
	private final int value;

	public Immutable(int value) {
		this.value = value;
	}

	public int Value 
	{
		get { return value; }
		private set;
	}
}
```
